[IN PROGRESS] STAR Particle Image Analysis
Georgia Institute of Technology – Summer 2025–Present

This project supports research on STAR (Skin-Targeted Active Release) particles—microscale, star-shaped devices designed to enhance drug delivery through the skin. I developed a Python-based computer vision pipeline to analyze microscopy images stained with GV dye, identifying and quantifying micropores created by the particles.
